Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

br   The plot is not only incoherent but also non existent  acting is mostly sub sub par with a gang of highly moronic and dreadful characters thrown in for bad measure  jokes are often spotted miles ahead and almost never even a bit amusing  This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties  the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies  but really  if you want that you can rent something from the  Adult  section  OK  br    br   I can hardly see anything here to recommend since you'll probably have a lot a better

friendship  battle of good and evil    all with a small budget  child actors  and few special effects  Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from     A sixth grader Kolya  Nick  Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels     years into the future  He discovers a near perfect  utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry  everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer  Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals  The device can be put to both good and bad use  depending on whose hands it falls into  When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone  it falls into the hands of   th century school boy Nick  With the pirates hot on his tracks  he travels back to his time  followed by the pirates  and Alice  Chaos  confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings  Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class  The catch is  Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like  while the pirates do  Also  the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone   Hmm  I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator     Who gets to Nick    and Mielophone    first  Excellent plot  non stop adventures  and great soundtrack  I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one   \",\n          \" National Treasure         is a thoroughly misguided hodge podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich  that has ever been written  The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates  how precious is that  I ask you    a seemingly normal fellow who  for no other reason than being of a lineage of like minded misguided fortune hunters  decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers  After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably  unintentionally  like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot  the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another   attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane  but disconnected misadventures  br    br   The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil  and then  going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U S  currency art work  is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining  Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country  Hence  we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth  Ben's intentions are noble   if confusing  He's set on protecting the treasure  For who and when  your guess is as good as mine  br    br   But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade  First up  his friend  Ian Holmes  Sean Bean  decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives  oh  yeah   brilliant idea    Presumably  the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune  So Ian tries to kill Ben  The assassination attempt is  of course  unsuccessful  if overly melodramatic  It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up  and pick on  the very sultry curator of the archives  Abigail Chase  Diane Kruger   She thinks Ben is clearly a nut   at least at the beginning  But true to action romance form  Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say   is that the Hope Diamond   The film moves into full X File ish mode  as the FBI  mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft  retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive  Honestly  don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct  In the final analysis   National Treasure  isn't great film making  so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies  woven together from scraps  the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush  br    br   The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of  The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors  natural flesh tones  solid blacks and clean whites  The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements  The audio is     and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism  Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made  If only  as an audience  we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co  were chasing after an illusive treasure  this might have been one good flick  Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer  audio commentary and deleted scenes  Not for the faint hearted   just the thick headed \"\n        ],\n

some pretty ladies  but really  if you want that you can rent something from the  Adult  section  OK           I can hardly see anything here to recommend since you'll probably have a lot a better and

battle of good and evil    all with a small budget  child actors  and few special effects  Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from     A sixth grader Kolya  Nick  Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels     years into the future  He discovers a near perfect  utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry  everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer  Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals  The device can be put to both good and bad use  depending on whose hands it falls into  When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone  it falls into the

pirates try to blend in with the earthlings  Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class  The catch is  Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like  while the pirates do  Also  the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone   Hmm  I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator     Who gets to Nick    and Mielophone    first  Excellent plot  non stop adventures  and great soundtrack  I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one   \",\n          \" National Treasure         is a thoroughly misguided hodge podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich  that has ever been written  The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates  how precious is that  I ask you    a seemingly normal fellow who  for no other reason than being of a lineage of like minded misguided fortune hunters  decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers  After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably  unintentionally  like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot  the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another   attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane  but disconnected misadventures           The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil  and then  going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U S  currency art work  is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining  Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country  Hence  we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth  Ben's intentions are noble   if confusing  He's set on protecting the treasure  For who and when  your guess is as good as mine           But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade  First up  his friend  Ian Holmes  Sean Bean  decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives  oh  yeah    illiant idea    Presumably  the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune  So Ian tries to kill Ben  The assassination attempt is  of course  unsuccessful  if overly melodramatic  It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up  and pick on  the very sultry curator of the archives  Abigail Chase  Diane Kruger   She thinks Ben is clearly a nut   at least at the beginning  But true to action romance form  Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say   is that the Hope Diamond   The film moves into full X File ish mode  as the FBI  mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft  retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive  Honestly  don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct  In the final analysis   National Treasure  isn't great film making  so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies  woven together from scraps  the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush           The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of  The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors  natural flesh tones  solid blacks and clean whites  The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements  The audio is     and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism  Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made  If only  as an audience  we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co  were chasing after an illusive treasure  this might have been one good flick  Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer  audio commentary and deleted scenes  Not for the faint hearted   just the thick headed \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

nearby had it I finally got a hold of it in an antique store and could n't wait to watch it Oh that I had seen it a couple years earlier and could 've really enjoyed it I was surprised that this movie was only or so minutes long and I think this is what made the plot and story so lacking The plot really does sound like a good one both on the trailer and the movie comments a teenager Angus Jesse Bradford and his newfound stray lab Yellow are marooned on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father Bruce Davison Together they manage to survive the wilderness and wait to be found and rescued Still what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events of the plot are very rushed There is a possible love interest between Angus and Sara but they 're never shown together for more than a moment Yellow is a mischievous dog the parents are reluctant to keep but in a few days he seems to be appreciated enough to join a boat trip The scene of the mother Mimi Rogers mentioning vaguely what death is like to the younger boy Joel Palmer does n't go anywhere In no time we learn that days have been spent on the island then suddenly it 's then Of all the animals a castaway could be exposed to in the wild only kind a wolf attacks them Why could n't something else have been a problem instead of having the same type of animal maybe even the same one strike twice There are few views of how Angus prepares food except when he discovers fruit and roots and when he roasts a trapped rat If he knows so much about survival skills why were n't more scenes with it shown The one thing that made me blank was why the dog did n't have much part alone When he is rescued and the dog is left behind on the island there is no scene showing how he survives without a human 's help I wished I was more open to this when watching it but I did enjoy some of this The acting was good and the score was enjoyable Though I found myself wondering why the father looked so much older than his family and why he and the main search and rescue conductor share names This is a good movie for kids but though the protagonist is nobody over would be interested with this\",\n          \"Twenty years ago the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later On the present days Michael Gordon Currie invites his girlfriend Peg Stacy Grant and his best friends Chris Myc Agnew Jennifer Emmanuelle Vaugier Lisa Ann Kelly Benson Ned Brendon Beiser Mitch Maldive Phillip Rhys and Trish Rachel Hayward to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his Indian friend Crow Byron Chief Moon they would perform an ancient Indian cele ation using the carved wooden dummy Morty Jon Fedele that would eliminate their fears forever The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father killing his friends The Fear Resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clich s There are some exaggerated performances like for example Ms Betsy Palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is ought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies The low pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation In the very end Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with minutes running time The special effects are very reasonable for a B movie My vote is four Title Brazil Fear Uma Noite de Halloween Fear One Night of Halloween\",\n          \"I mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car So what if their ten It 's way too immature for a little kid to sing about being my women I mean seriously The name is pretty corny too naked others just because they take off their pants HOW CREATIVE I do n't get why they need a TV show I mean most artist do n't really need a TV show about themselves especially the naked others band Heck how many of them are in the freaking group And seriously whats with the movie Jeez Nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously The naked other band SO many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the Naked
